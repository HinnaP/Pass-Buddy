Using Apple’s password generator can be tricky, and saving your passwords in the keychain could be risky if it gets compromised. Experts also advise against storing passwords in the notes app, and writing them down on paper isn’t secure either. So, what’s the solution? Meet Pass Buddy—a secure app designed to safely store your passwords and even help you generate strong, unique ones.
